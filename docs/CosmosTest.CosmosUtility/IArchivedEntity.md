Can be added to [`CosmosEntity`](CosmosEntity.md) derived classes that want to support soft deletion in a consistent manner. Can be used with [`WhereIsArchived`](CosmosExtensions/WhereIsArchived.md) and [`WhereIsNotArchived`](CosmosExtensions/WhereIsNotArchived.md).

```csharp
public interface IArchivedEntity
```
