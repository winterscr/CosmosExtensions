# CosmosExtensions class

A collection of useful extensions for working with Cosmos queries.

```csharp
public static class CosmosExtensions
```

## Public Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| static [FirstOrDefaultAsync&lt;T&gt;](CosmosExtensions/FirstOrDefaultAsync.md)(…) | Execute a cosmos query asynchronously only retrieving a single value or null. |
| static [MappedFirstOrDefaultAsync&lt;TEntity,TResult&gt;](CosmosExtensions/MappedFirstOrDefaultAsync.md)(…) | Execute a cosmos query asynchronously only retrieving the first value or null. The result is mapped if not null. If using AutoMapper then consider using ProjectTo() for simple projection instead, unless performing value conversion or other complex maps. |
| static [ToAsyncEnumerable&lt;T&gt;](CosmosExtensions/ToAsyncEnumerable.md)(…) | Execute a cosmos query as an IAsyncEnumerable. |
| static [ToMappedAsyncEnumerable&lt;TEntity,TResult&gt;](CosmosExtensions/ToMappedAsyncEnumerable.md)(…) | Execute a cosmos query as an IAsyncEnumerable and map the resulting objects. If using AutoMapper then consider using ProjectTo() for simple projection instead, unless performing value conversion or other complex maps. |
| static [WhereCommon&lt;T&gt;](CosmosExtensions/WhereCommon.md)(…) | Include common predicates where the type of the entity matches and the version is at most as specified. |
| static [WhereCommonAttributed&lt;T&gt;](CosmosExtensions/WhereCommonAttributed.md)(…) | Include common predicates to the query to filter on the type of the entity and max version of the entity version. The entity type must be attributed with [`CosmosEntityInfoAttribute`](CosmosEntityInfoAttribute.md). This overload will return all entries that match, ignoring the IsArchived flag if present on the entity. |
| static [WhereInPartition&lt;T&gt;](CosmosExtensions/WhereInPartition.md)(…) | Limits the query to the specified partition. |
| static [WhereIsArchived&lt;T&gt;](CosmosExtensions/WhereIsArchived.md)(…) | Include only entities that are archived. See remarks for information on unit testing. |
| static [WhereIsNotArchived&lt;T&gt;](CosmosExtensions/WhereIsNotArchived.md)(…) | Include only entities that are not archived. See remarks for information on unit testing. |
| static [WhereType&lt;T&gt;](CosmosExtensions/WhereType.md)(…) | Include only entities of the specified type. |
| static [WhereTypeAndVersion&lt;T&gt;](CosmosExtensions/WhereTypeAndVersion.md)(…) | Include only entities with the specific type and version. |
| static [WhereVersion&lt;T&gt;](CosmosExtensions/WhereVersion.md)(…) | Include only entities at the specified version. |
| static [WhereVersionAtLeast&lt;T&gt;](CosmosExtensions/WhereVersionAtLeast.md)(…) | Include only entities where the version is higher or equal to the specified version. |
| static [WhereVersionAtMost&lt;T&gt;](CosmosExtensions/WhereVersionAtMost.md)(…) | Include only entities where the version is lower or equal to the specified version. |
